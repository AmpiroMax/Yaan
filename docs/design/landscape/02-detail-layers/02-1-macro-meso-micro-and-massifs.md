## 2. Detail layers and worldgen pass order

Three layers, placed in strict pass order. Determinism per Rule 13.1: every
pass draws only from `WorldGenRng` streams keyed by (seed, cell/chunk, pass).
For scatter that must agree across chunk borders, cluster/patch centers live on
world-space jittered lattices keyed by lattice-cell coords (same trick as the
value-noise lattice) — a chunk computes any center whose radius touches it,
so neighbors agree without communication.

| # | Pass | Layer | Produces |
|---|---|---|---|
| P1 | Macro heightfield | macro | base fBm + feature stamps (crag, valley flattening, redistribution) |
| P2 | Hydrology | macro | river path + carve, lake basin, water surface data, shore mask |
| P3 | Surface classification | macro | biome/splat inputs per sample: slope, height, dist-to-water |
| P4 | Sites & structures | meso | flattened building pads, POI placement, POI-chain validation (C1–C4) |
| P5 | Meso scatter | meso | forest masses, tree clusters, clearings, rock outcrops |
| P6 | Micro scatter | micro | grass/flower/stone parameters (density maps; instances mostly render-side) |

Sites (P4) run **before** forests (P5) so settlements reserve their clearings;
forests run before micro so grass respects canopy. This mirrors Horizon Zero
Dawn's layered placement: coarse density/exclusion maps first, fine scatter
sampled against them.

### 2.1 Macro (mountains, ridgelines, water bodies, forest masses)

- **When:** P1–P2 (+ forest *mass outlines* decided in P5 from a coarse
  moisture-like noise field, but their masks are macro objects).
- **What:** current gentle-hills fBm (octaves 512/24, 128/6, 32/1.5 — already
  flagged for NUMBERS.md at sync №2) plus, in v2: one ridged-noise crag stamp
  per valley (L0), valley-floor redistribution (`pow`-curve toward flats, per
  procgen practice), river/lake carving.
- **Landform anisotropy (user feedback, feature_requests.md Запрос 1):**
  mid-scale hills must read as elongated, direction-coherent landforms —
  ridgelets with a legible long axis — never isotropic round bumps
  («холмики-сиськи» are explicitly rejected by the user). Implementable
  without hand sculpting: stretch **the mid-frequency octave only**
  (currently the 128 m / 6 m layer — it is what makes round bumps at hill
  scale) by `HILL_ANISOTROPY` (**approved in NUMBERS.md: 2.5**, stage-3
  close) along a per-valley axis field; the macro-roll and fine-texture octaves
  stay isotropic, and the ridged transform on the L0 stamp already covers
  crag flanks. **Technique decided (plan of record, core + design sync):
  anisotropic input-stretch, not domain-warp.** Input-stretch lengthens
  features *along* the axis (the requested elongation itself) while the
  cross-axis wavelength — the rhythm corridors and the C1 standpoint grid
  actually feel when crossing ridgelets — stays pinned at the current
  128 m. Domain-warp is the opposite trade (preserves average wavelength
  but wiggles crests and dilutes the shared-axis read) — rejected.
  Ping-first threshold: if axis-field drift locally compresses the
  cross-axis rhythm below ~100 m, core pings design before it lands. The axis field is a slowly-varying seeded angle: ridgelets
  share a long axis *locally* while the axis drifts across the map — a
  single global direction would read as corduroy. Recorded caution
  (core, stage-3b sync): warping the hill octave shifts drainage
  micro-shape — the seed-1 river trace WILL move; this is safe *only*
  because of the derived-only rule (§7.1a), which is exactly the case that
  rule exists for. Gates cleared at stage-3 close (sync №3):
  `HILL_ANISOTROPY` = 2.5 landed in NUMBERS.md and the P1 retune is
  scheduled — canopy-aware C1 re-validation is automatic in the suite,
  and a compliance pass over the retune tour frames follows. Acceptance: tour
  frames of open meadow show hills with an obvious long axis roughly
  agreeing with their neighbors.
- **Quantization warning (core contract):** all chunks share one quantization
  range (offset 0, scale MAX/65535). Raising the L0 above the current 31.5 m
  ceiling requires raising the shared range — **(предложение — утвердить:
  `WORLDGEN_MAX_HEIGHT` = 64 m)**. Height resolution stays ~1 mm; no contract
  change beyond the constant.
- **Density guidance:** exactly 1 L0 per valley; forest masses cover 25–40 %
  of walkable land **(предложение — утвердить: `FOREST_COVERAGE` = 0.25–0.40,
  testbed target 0.30)**; open meadow the rest minus water/rock.
- **Must never:** place macro mass so that it hides the L0 from more than
  40 % of open ground (violates C1/`LANDMARK_VISIBILITY_MIN`); create local
  minima with no hydrology resolution (§3); exceed walkable slope on all
  approaches to any POI (every POI keeps ≥ 1 approach corridor under 25°
  average slope — see critical-path rule §2.4).

### 2.2 Meso (hills, clearings, river bends, outcrops, tree clusters)

- **When:** P4–P5.
- **What & density (all предложение — утвердить):**
  - Forest interior clearings: one per 150–250 m of forest extent
    (`CLEARING_INTERVAL`), radius 15–30 m (`CLEARING_RADIUS`); clearings host
    L2 rewards (flower patch, stone, FUTURE camp).
  - Rock outcrops in open land: on a jittered lattice of cell 120 m
    (`OUTCROP_CELL` = 120 m, ~1 per 14 000 m² with 30 % skip chance); 2–6
    boulders each, 1–3 m; prefer convex ground and slope 15–35°.
  - Tree clusters outside forest masses: 3–7 trees, on a jittered lattice of
    cell 90 m in meadows (`MEADOW_CLUSTER_CELL` = 90 m, 40 % skip).
  - River bends: hydrology path smoothing keeps sinuosity ≥ 1.15 (path length
    / straight distance) so banks create pockets and reveal beats.
- **Must never:** block the POI-chain corridors (§2.4); violate the L0 sight
  wedges / clearance factor of C4 (checked by the canopy-aware raycast
  validation of C1 — terrain-only checks are insufficient, see C4); float
  above or intersect water.

### 2.3 Micro (grass, flowers, bushes, stones, sand patches)

- **When:** P6 computes deterministic *parameters* (density maps, patch
  centers); actual instancing is render-side against those maps (Horizon
  model), so micro never enters the .dfw entity list and never costs
  streaming-path ECS churn (Rule 11 friendly).
- **What & density (all предложение — утвердить):**
  - Grass cards: only within `GRASS_VIEW_DISTANCE` = 50 m of camera,
    0.5–1.5 cards/m² on grass-splat ground (`GRASS_DENSITY`); at low res more
    is visual noise.
  - Flower patches: centers on 60 m jittered lattice in open grass, 50 % skip;
    patch radius 3–8 m; 1–3 blossoms/m² inside (`FLOWER_PATCH_*`). One accent
    hue per patch (palette discipline).
  - Loose stones: 0.005–0.02 /m² on grass and dirt (`STONE_DENSITY`), size
    0.2–0.6 m.
  - Bushes: forest edges (within 10 m outside a forest mask edge) and clearing
    rims, 0.01–0.03 /m² there (`BUSH_EDGE_DENSITY`).
  - Sand patches: from the shore mask only (§3.3) — never freestanding inland
    at this stage.
- **Must never:** affect collision or the critical path (micro is
  walk-through by contract); hide interactables (Q11 highlight must stay
  visible over grass — cap grass height at 0.4 m, `GRASS_HEIGHT_MAX`);
  exceed the render micro budget (render zone owns the actual instance caps —
  these densities are the *design* ceiling).

### 2.4 Critical-path protection (applies to every layer)

The POI chain of C3 defines corridors: straight-ish bands 10 m wide
**(предложение — утвердить: `CORRIDOR_WIDTH` = 10 m)** between chained POIs,
refined by a cheap downhill-biased path trace. Inside a corridor:

- slope along the walking direction ≤ 25° average (under `PLAYER_MAX_SLOPE`
  with margin), no step > `PLAYER_STEP_HEIGHT`;
- no structures, no forest-density trees (isolated trees allowed if spacing
  ≥ 12 m), no boulders > 1 m;
- rivers crossed only at fords (§3.1).

Corridors are a *mask* consumed by P4–P6, not visible content. FUTURE: roads
will be built along a subset of corridors.

### 2.5 The regional landmark massif — the temple mountain (LR)

The far goal: high, cliffy, uneven, with a walkable ascent and a temple on
top. Ravenscar keeps the valley and the story; this keeps the horizon.

**Scale (предложение — утвердить).** `LR_RELIEF` = 280 m above the
surrounding plain (proposed band 250–350). `LR_BASE_RADIUS` = 600–700 m, i.e.
mean flank slope ≈ 25° — that ratio is what makes it read as a **massif**
rather than a spike; a cone steep enough to be dramatic at the summit must be
broad enough at the foot to look like it belongs to the ground. Sited ≥
`LANDMARK_HAZE_ONSET` (800 m) from the valley, in practice the far corner
(≈ 1.4–1.6 km out). Readability (§1.5): at 1500 m anything ≥ 50 m reads, so
the massif is unmistakable while its temple (15–20 m) only resolves inside
≈ 600 m — the temple is the reward for approaching, exactly like the castle.
This requires `WORLDGEN_MAX_HEIGHT` 64 → **400 m**.

**"Cliffy and uneven" as generator rules — the user explicitly rejects smooth
domes, so these are invariants, not suggestions:**

1. **Ridged noise, not fBm**, for the massif field: `r = 1 − |2n − 1|`
   summed over octaves. fBm makes domes; ridged noise makes spines.
2. **Radial buttress ridges:** `LR_RIDGE_COUNT` = 4–7 ridges descending from
   the summit with couloirs between, as an angular modulation
   `h *= 1 + A·cos(k·θ + φ(θ))` with `φ` from noise so the ridges are
   **irregular, never symmetric** (a symmetric star reads as artificial).
3. **Cliff bands:** above `LR_CLIFFLINE` (⅓ height), quantize elevation into
   bands of `LR_CLIFF_BAND` = 8–15 m spaced 30–60 m vertically, blended just
   enough to avoid stair-stepping artefacts. This is the "cliffy" read and it
   feeds §4's splat directly (rock above 40°).
4. **Asymmetry:** one flank biased steep (a scarp face), the opposite gentler
   — the gentle side carries the ascent. Real mountains are not radially
   uniform and neither is this one.
5. **THE ANTI-DOME INVARIANT — SUPERSEDED BY §2.8, AND THAT SECTION IS NOW
   THE CONTRACT.** The rule as first written here (lobed ⅔ slice at
   `LR_LOBE_RATIO` ≥ 1.35 plus ≥ 60 % of the upper surface above 40°) was
   scoped to the LR and never evaluated on anything. The user rejected the
   mountain a third time while looking at **Ravenscar**, which this section
   does not govern. Both halves of that failure — the scoping and the
   insufficiency of a single-slice plan-view test — are worked through in
   **§2.8**, which replaces this item and applies to *every* massif including
   this one. `LR_LOBE_RATIO` is renamed `MASSIF_LOBE_RATIO` there: the
   constant's **name was the bug**.

**The ascent is mandatory and validated.** A continuous walkable route from
the foot to the summit must exist: average slope ≤ 25°, nowhere exceeding
`PLAYER_MAX_SLOPE`, no step > `PLAYER_STEP_HEIGHT`. Same class of invariant
as the castle ramp (§6.1.2) — a summit temple you cannot reach on foot is a
failed placement, not a later problem. Derived from the generated massif,
never tabled.

**"7000 steps" — a staged climb, not a switchback (user requirement).** The
ascent is a *sequence*, not a ramp: `LR_ASCENT_LENGTH` = 1200–1800 m of path
(4–6× the direct horizontal distance, so the route wraps the massif rather
than attacking it) with `LR_ASCENT_LANDINGS` = **7** staged rests — a shrine,
a vista, a wind-scoured shoulder — each a place to stop and look back at how
far the valley has fallen away **(предложение — утвердить; pinned from the
former 5–7 band by story, one landing per station of the naming rite)**.

**Seven verifies rhythmically, which is why it is pinned rather than merely
accepted.** Over the 1200–1800 m path, seven landings give segments of
171–257 m, i.e. **57–86 s of walking at `WALK_SPEED`** — inside the testbed's
`POI_TRAVEL_TIME` band (60–90 s) across the whole range. The climb's internal
rhythm therefore matches the valley's exploration rhythm: the player already
knows, in their legs, how long "one stretch to the next thing" takes, and the
ascent speaks the same cadence. Each station also gains ≈ 40 m of relief, so
the view genuinely changes between them rather than repeating. Landings are what
make a climb read as long; raw distance just makes it tiring. At 1500 m that
is ≈ 8 min of walking one way, which is a journey.

**The Steps are BUILT and UNREPAIRED (story canon, and it costs nothing).**
The ascent is a **stair**, not a bare path: cut treads and revetted edges
following the route, in four generations of disrepair — worn and dished
treads, sections slumped or collapsed with the path detouring around them,
vegetation encroaching at the margins, revetment shed downslope as rubble.
Hard constraint: **disrepair is visual and routing, never impassable.** No gap
exceeds `PLAYER_STEP_HEIGHT`, every collapsed section has a walkable detour
within the ascent's slope band, and the summit stays reachable — the crown
kept the order poor, but nobody ever forbade the climb.

**Each landing is a STATION** (story: a pilgrim speaks a name at each). So
each carries a small built marker — a station stone, a niche, a lintel — sized
as an L2 guide, and the landing is a *place*, not merely a flat spot on a
path. Consequence to respect: `LR_ASCENT_LANDINGS` now has **narrative
dependents** — seven landings is seven recitation beats, and story's folk
etymology hangs the stair's name on the seven stations rather than on any step
count (which is what lets the name have a source in the world while the user's
"never count steps" rule stays intact). Changing the count changes a rite; it
is no longer a free pacing knob, and moves through story the way the castle's
completion fraction does.
> **⚠ TWO DIFFERENT CLIMBS — do not conflate them.** This world has two

**DECIDED — user, 09:08:2026: "7000 steps" is a NAME, not a step count.**
(«НЕ буквально, 8 минут — кайф, название оставляем».) The numbers above stand
as written — 1200–1800 m, 5–7 landings, ≈ 8 min one way — and the climb keeps
its name in the fiction, which is story's to use in canon. Closed; do not
reopen on the arithmetic.

### 2.6 Border mountains — the world edge

Replaces the invisible walls. The world ends in geography, Skyrim-style.

- **Band:** `BORDER_BAND_WIDTH` = 200–300 m of mountain, preceded by
  `BORDER_FOOTHILL_WIDTH` = 100–200 m of rising ridgelets so the player
  climbs *into* it rather than meeting it **(предложение — утвердить)**.
- **Height:** crest at `BORDER_CREST_HEIGHT` = 150–250 m above local terrain,
  **varied ±30 % along its length** at a long wavelength (600–1200 m).
- **Not a wall — three shape rules:** (1) crest height varies as above, so it
  reads as a *range*; (2) spurs push inward irregularly by 100–250 m so the
  boundary is lobed, never straight — a straight edge is the tell that gives
  away a box; (3) the inner face uses the same ridged/cliff-band rules as
  §2.5, never a uniform slope.
- **Impassability: slope first, validation second.** The inner face averages
  ≥ 55° over ≥ 40 m of climb, which exceeds `PLAYER_MAX_SLOPE` (~50°) — but
  noise *will* occasionally produce a walkable saddle, so slope alone is not
  trusted. A traversability flood-fill from inside the playable area must
  fail to reach the outer edge; where it succeeds the generator raises the
  offending saddle and re-runs. Geometry plus a test, not a promise. Keep a
  hard clamp far outside the band as engineering safety — but it is a
  backstop nobody should ever touch, not a design element.
- **Border mountains are NOT attractors** (§1.3a): they are the frame. They
  never satisfy C1's "something to see" test — a wall of rock is not content,
  and letting it count would license genuinely empty ground.

### 2.7 Ground micro-relief and the plain

**Everything is slightly uneven.** The complaint is that the land reads flat;
§2.1's anisotropy gave us hill-scale ridgelets, and this is the layer below
it. Add a fourth octave, `GROUND_MICRO_WAVELENGTH` = 8–16 m at
`GROUND_MICRO_AMPLITUDE` = 0.3–0.6 m. **THE FIFTH OCTAVE (2–4 m / 0.1–0.2 m,
«surface tooth») IS WITHDRAWN — REASSIGNED, NOT DELETED (§10.12.4).** §10.2 rules
that band outside the heightmap's reach: at `LOD_VOXEL_SIZE_L0` = 1.0 m a
2–4 m period is sampled 2–4 times and aliases rather than reading as relief.
The work it described is real and is now **objects** — B1's small end, B6's
tufts, the gravel of reference frame 01. Do not re-propose it as an octave. At 0.5 m over a
12 m wavelength the local slope is ≈ 5°, so this is free: it never threatens
`PLAYER_STEP_HEIGHT`, corridors, or building pads, and it kills the
billiard-table read at eye level. Micro-relief is **suppressed inside
building pads and the castle terrace** (they are cut flat on purpose) and
**retained everywhere else, including the plain**.

**Implementation status and the water constraint (core, stage-4 — this octave
had never actually been built anywhere).** It went in first on the massif's
benches, where §2.8.2 requires it. Core's attempt to apply it *globally* at
the same time was correctly backed out on a measurement: ±0.3–0.6 m on the
shoreline dropped bank dips below the water surface, and they rendered as
WaterBed past the §3.3 cap. That is a real finding and it produces the missing
rule rather than a reason to stay scoped:

- **Micro-relief AMPLITUDE TAPERS TO ZERO ACROSS THE SHORE BAND**, driven by
  the `dist_to_water` field that §4 and §5 already consume. No new data, no
  new constant — the taper simply reuses the shore mask.
- **This is physically right, not a workaround.** Ground beside water is flat
  *because water flattens it*: floodplains, banks and lake margins are
  deposited surfaces. A river running through a field of 0.5 m bumps is the
  artefact; the flat bank is the truth. So the rule improves the world at the
  same time as it fixes the bug, which is the shape a good constraint usually
  has.
- **The massif-only scoping is INTERIM and must not settle.** A micro octave
  that exists above the cliffline and nowhere else makes the cliffline a
  character seam — precisely the failure the "general, not forest-specific"
  ruling below exists to prevent, relocated from the forest edge to the
  mountain's hem. The general pass is its own scheduled item, gated on the
  shore taper plus a check against corridors, fords and building pads.

**Meso relief — the missing middle band (stage-4).** Between the hill octave
(128 m / 6 m, §2.1) and the micro octave above there was a gap, and it is
exactly the scale at which walking through a forest felt like a flat traverse.
Add `GROUND_MESO_WAVELENGTH` = 25–60 m at `GROUND_MESO_AMPLITUDE` = 1.5–4 m
**(предложение — утвердить)** — dips, rises and hollows you walk into and out
of. Max local slope ≈ 18°, so corridors and pads are unaffected.

**Terrain does NOT flatten under vegetation — vegetation absorbs the terrain.**
Stated because the opposite fix is the tempting one and it would undo this
whole section: micro and meso relief deliberately make the ground under a tree
uneven (a 1.2 m trunk on `TREE_SLOPE_MAX` spans ≈ 0.84 m of drop across its
own base, before roughness), and the answer is **geometry on the plant** — a
root flare that buries its own skirt (§5.10) — never a flattened disc of lawn
beneath every trunk. A forest floor smoothed under each stem is a pool table
with trees on it, which is precisely the flatness complaint that produced this
section. Any future "trees are floating" bug is a flora/render fix, not a
terrain one.

**Ruling: this is GENERAL terrain, not a forest-specific stamp.** Forests
merely sit on it. Three reasons: a forest-only stamp makes the forest edge a
seam where terrain character visibly changes — the classic tell of generated
ground; meadows want the same relief (it is the same "too flat" complaint);
and the *perception* that forests have more relief comes free, because trunks
and canopy give the eye something to measure height against, while open meadow
reads flatter at identical amplitude.

**Scarps (обрывы).** Small cliff steps `SCARP_HEIGHT` = 2–5 m, placed where
the meso field's local slope already exceeds a threshold, by a low-probability
terracing transform — `SCARP_DENSITY` = 0.5–1.5 per hectare inside forest
masses, rarer in open ground **(предложение — утвердить)**. Constraints: never
inside a corridor mask (§2.4); never enclosing a walkable region (a scarp is
an obstacle to go around, never a trap — the traversability check of §2.6
applies locally); and always with a walkable way around within 40 m, so a
scarp costs the player a decision, not a reload.

**One small plain, and it earns its flatness.** A flat area is only valuable
as contrast, so it is placed where flatness *does something*:
`PLAIN_EXTENT` = 400–600 m across, on the route from the valley toward the
LR, positioned so that **the massif is fully revealed and unobstructed from
it**. The enclosed valley opens onto the plain, and the mountain is suddenly
the whole horizon — that is the reveal beat (§1.4), and it is the reason this
is a composition and not a bald patch. Rules inside it: flat to ±1.5 m
overall, micro-relief retained (flat, not sterile), no forest mass, only
sparse L2 (standing stones, a lone skyline tree) so the openness reads as
intentional. The plain is also the natural site for a future FUTURE road and
for the act-scale muster/travel beats story may want.
